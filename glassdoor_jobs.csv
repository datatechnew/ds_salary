Fundation is a high growth, private equity backed technology enabled online commercial lender dedicated to enhancing the borrowing process for small business owners across the United States. We are changing the landscape of lending to small and medium sized businesses nationwide through a streamlined, data-driven, digital lending process.

Our standard product is a fixed rate, 1-4 year fully amortizing term installment loan (similar to a car loan or mortgage) with no prepayment penalties. Because we use our own capital (a balance sheet lender), we employ risk-based pricing to lend to businesses with varying credit profiles and for various purposes – working capital, inventory, capital improvements, equipment purchases, expansion of facilities, acquisitions and ownership related events. We do not sell our loans and we control the servicing throughout the life of the loan.

Our partners include banks and other financial institutions, business brokers, business advisors, vendors of supplies, equipment, and services; online service providers, software providers and professional service firms. In each partnership, we customize our product offering and our delivery model to meet the needs of each unique partner and its customers. Our partnerships range from customized vendor financing programs, discrete transaction/deal assistance, fully integrated lending platforms, and customer cross-sell through coordinated marketing programs.

We are always looking for people that value the opportunity to work hard, have fun on the job, and make a difference in the lives of others through their work every day!

WhiteHatAI is a division of Sharecare. WhiteHatAI is working with Special Investigations Units (SIU) for major U.S. payers who believe fraud alone in their organizations accounts for 10% of their total healthcare claims transaction volume. These units are currently recovering less than 2% of their fraud, leaving billions of dollars in losses.
The rules-based, retrospective, analytic systems currently used have proven insufficient in combating FWA. The market is missing the critical ingredient for fighting FWA prepayment; a flexible prepayment solution that moves investigative efforts from post payment to prepayment. This need creates a tremendous opportunity. The market is searching for the prepayment Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach provided by WhiteHatAI. The combination of the maturity of AI technologies and increasing FWA makes this the perfect time for WhiteHatAI.

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Architecture and design of highly available/scalable distributed systems.
Design and development of streaming data platforms using Kafka Streams, Spark, Flink, Storm, Beam or Cloud Dataflow.
Experience with functional/event-driven programming.

Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a DevOps project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.8,"Object Partners Inc

We are there when it matters - committed to life’s moments and the people who create them. We partner with the best retail stores in over 1200 cities across North America to serve up the best buying experience. Drizly offers a huge selection and competitive pricing with a side of personalized content. That is what we do. Who we are is a different story.

We are more than just another tech company. There is an intellectual curiosity that occurs at Drizly. We have a desire to question, to understand, to figure it out. Bottom line, we solve it. We value not just the truth but the process to get to the truth, to deliberate, decide and then act. Most importantly, we care. We care about our customer. We care about our company. We care about our team. There will be long days and incredible challenges.

We are blazing a trail in an industry that hasn’t changed in nearly a century, and that doesn’t scare us (well, not all the time) -and even when it does, it doesn’t stop us, it energizes us.

Do you see yourself here? Read on.

Who you are

You are currently at the intersection of data science and retention marketing analytics, and you want to dive even deeper into both worlds. You have the operational ability to improve Drizly’s current marketing automations, CRM workflow inefficiencies, consumer segmentation processes, and champion our product vision to build Drizly’s roadmap of personalization. You have the empathy to understand our business from the eyes of a consumer, and you have the results driven mindset to drive improvements to Drizly’s experience that move the bottom line. You have a technical toolset which includes complex SQL, Python, scikit, Git, visualization tools, etc).

You love working with teams including Data Engineering and Business Intelligence to transform raw data into highly actionable business insights through Looker, as well as partnering with retention marketing and product teams to turn those insights into action. You also know how to work the other direction - how to implement and manage retention initiatives to ensure that data collection is seamless and comprehensive. You have a proven track record designing, implementing, and measuring solutions in the analytics space.

If you're coming from a consumer-facing ecommerce marketplace, that’s great! We deal with massive amounts of messy and eventstream data from a variety of internal and external sources.

If you have also delivered event streaming solutions, even better! You will feel right at home if you have deployed and maintained production data science models, set up data pipelines with schema validation and testing, or worked on problems involving customer segmentation, uplift modeling, recommendations, and attribution.

What the role is

We are looking for someone to build the future of customer personalization at Drizly. This person will support and optimize existing marketing automations, and partner with product and marketing to drive meaningful personalization. They will create touchpoints that differentiate the Drizly shopping experience across web, mobile web + app, email, push, and more.

The Data Scientist is a critical member of the Analytics organization, and will work closely with Data Engineering and BI, as well as the cross-functional Retention Growth team. They will certainly be responsible for supporting individual campaigns and product solutions, but also for the larger vision of how a data architecture, codebase, and best practices for consumer retention should grow with Drizly over time. Ultimately, this person will determine the ground truth, roadmap, and reporting lens through which Drizly will be enabled to deliver memorable and relevant experiences for our customers.
In this role you will:
Partner with product and marketing to drive personalization at scale across the product and notification layer, across Drizly’s consumer apps, websites, email, push, and more
Develop and execute retention growth process improvements through a complete lifecycle of experimental design, testing, measurement, and implementation

Maintain and improve the data infrastructure, documentation, codebase, internal processes, and standards of the Analytics Team
Integrate consumer and operational data sets from multiple internal and external sources

The Other Stuff:

Competitive salary
One-on-one professional coaching with an external expert
Health, Dental and Vision Insurance
Flexible vacation policy
401(K) Plan
Added perks

Data Scientist,$80K-$138K (Glassdoor est.),"Common Networks was founded on the idea that everyone should have a choice for fast, affordable access to broadband internet. Right now, most homes in the U.S. don't. In fact, 62% of homes live in a monopoly broadband market. High-speed access unlocks all the superpowers on the internet. When it works, it can be a great leveling force across the world, giving everyone access to educational tools, entertainment, immediate translations, or even medical care that they wouldn’t otherwise have.

Common Networks provides suburban neighborhoods with internet using wireless technology. We interconnect homes in a neighborhood, creating a mesh network between homes and our fiber internet sources. A whole community can then have fast and reliable internet service with only a few locations needing fiber access.

As our first Data Scientist, you will own our entire data pipeline, from instrumentation and extraction to analytical presentations to the executive team. Building Internet infrastructure is expensive and our business model relies on leveraging data to find as many efficiencies as possible. To that end, you’ll work with Product to find creative ways to reduce hardware costs, with Growth to squeeze every last conversion out of our onboarding funnel, with Engineering to discern network-wide ramifications of minute changes to router kernel parameters, with Coverage to sketch out the best buildings to target when we launch new markets, and with Operations to identify process breaks before they show up in our top-level metrics.

The ideal candidate is passionate about democratizing our data and eager to wear many hats -- one day might entail installing Tableau and coaching stakeholders on best practices with the new BI tool, while another might involve changing our backend to emit that one metric that’s going to drastically simplify the analysis you’re trying to run. Our entire stack runs on GCP, with BigQuery as our data warehouse and all of our backend written in golang on Google’s Appengine -- bonus points if you come in with experience in those technologies, but we’d also be thrilled to invest in a great candidate that hasn’t worked with those exact products.

Build and maintain dashboards for core operational metrics (e.g. network reliability, growth funnel)
Own the methodologies behind how we measure ourselves and create new metrics as the business evolves
Clean and organize our data warehouse, manage scheduled aggregations, and expose rich views of data to stakeholders
Run your own investigations into our trickiest problems, finding approachable ways to present and visualize your findings to the rest of the company
Implement simple changes to our codebase when necessary -- you don’t let yourself get blocked on engineering
Chart out Common’s data roadmap, striking the right balance between quick-and-dirty analysis vs. building out robust, scalable data flows.
Requirements
BS with 5+ years of professional experience in a Data Scientist or Data Analyst role
Solid programming skills in at least one language in addition to excellent SQL skills
Experience working with and manipulating large, complex datasets.
Experience solving non-routine analysis problems, choosing the appropriate analytical methods and carrying the entire analysis from initial data gathering and requirements specification to final reporting and stakeholder presentation
Experience building, managing and organizing ETLs and data pipelinesExperience working with stakeholders to produce golden data datasets and clear views of common data needs
Excited to work in a startup environment on a small team; creative, resourceful, comfortable in a fast-moving environment. Excited to take on a wide range of responsibilities and cover many different roles loosely aligned around Data.
Demonstrated leadership and self-direction with a willingness to both teach others and learn new techniques.

Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.

But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.

Our Company & Culture

We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.

Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.

Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody.",4.3,"Brightidea

Sr. Data Scientist II,$110K-$145K (Glassdoor est.),"Data Scientist

Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker, and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today things are different. The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story.

You have experience with relational databases such as PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQL Server, and maybe even Hadoop, Hive, Spark or Redshift.
You strive to learn the newest and greatest techniques where BERT/ELMo are not just Sesame Street© characters.
What you’ll own
The foundation for advanced analytics at a global company.
The roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives.
Manage the entire lifecycle of data projects from strategic planning to tactical activities (data collection, cleanup, analysis, model implementation).
Sourcing new data for a firm that rarely scrapes, pulls or pushes.
Facilitate communication throughout the development process between executive stakeholders, your users and technical teams.
Coordinate and build strong working relations with various internal stakeholder groups, including IT, engineering, and legal.

About Us VIDEO

Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.

You

As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.

The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""

Us

The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.

Your Day

While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:
Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.
Required Skills / Experiences
Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.

This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.
Desired Skills / Experiences
2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.
Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.
You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.
Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.

Machine Learning Scientist – Data Team,$26K-$50K (Glassdoor est.),"Come join our team, and together we’ll realize the true potential of gene therapy!

Who we are

Dyno Therapeutics is a Cambridge based, VC-backed biotech startup that uses next-gen DNA technologies and machine learning to engineer Adeno-associated Virus (AAV) capsids for the effective delivery of gene therapies.

What we offer you

As a member of our quickly growing company, you’ll help us shape Dyno into a startup that takes its scientific mission seriously and provides a positive and supportive workplace environment. Dyno will have the opportunity to benefit from your insight, skills, and talent while enriching your professional and scientific experience as we grow the company together.

Our mission

At Dyno, we are expanding the boundaries of gene therapy. AAV capsids are currently the vector of choice for gene therapy, but they are only a starting point in the gene therapy revolution. Dyno aims to dramatically extend the reach of gene therapy by overcoming the limitations of existing AAV capsids, allowing more therapies to reach the clinic. Doing so will enable treatment for millions of patients with currently incurable, often disabling and deadly diseases.

How?

Dyno’s groundbreaking engineering pipeline harnesses advances in DNA library synthesis, high-throughput sequencing, and machine learning to generate transformative gene therapy vectors. We target the major barriers that separate AAV gene therapy research from real-world therapies, including delivery efficiency, tissue and cell-type specificity, immune evasion, and more. Our vectors will accelerate the transition of gene therapies from the lab to the clinic for the benefit of patients worldwide.

Where?

Dyno is located near Kendall Square in Cambridge. Situated within the dynamic LabCentral community, Dyno is working alongside other startups that are also creating the future of biomedicine.

General role

The data science team is at the heart of Dyno’s platform, and your work as a part of this team will have a potentially major impact on the future of gene therapy. The team's responsibilities span biological data analysis, machine learning model building, computational optimization, and experimental design of high-throughput viral libraries. Opportunities to apply rigorous theoretical approaches from combinatorial optimization, bayesian optimization, bandit strategies, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and compressive sensing in our platform abound. The successful candidate will have expertise in one of these (or related) topics and would like to apply them to a new domain. The field of capsid engineering is ripe with problems that are interesting from a learning perspective, and Dyno is well-placed to generate data at a scale at which these approaches can be fruitful.

As an early member of our team, you will have the opportunity to help craft our approach, shape our culture, and positively impact people’s lives. You will work closely with a group of talented, driven, and fun scientists. We are located in Lab Central in a dynamic community of biotech startups. The guideline below should give you a rough picture of who we are looking for, but depending on your background, you may bring different qualities to our team. Don't hesitate to write to us if you think you are a good fit. We offer competitive benefits.

Basic qualifications

About the Role:

The Data Scientist will join a core group of analysts who play an important role in generating strategic insights across the VNSNY organization in these four applications of data science:
Clinical - Who is going to get sick? What can we do to prevent or mitigate these health events? When is the best time to implement these actions? This application of data science examines the drivers of clinical outcomes; analyzes opportunities for managing risk-based populations; evaluates programs and interventions that aim to improve patient outcomes.
Quality How is quality of care measured and how is it related to patient outcomes? Where are opportunities to improve the quality of care to our patients and members? Our data scientists serve as subject matter experts on healthcare quality measurement and risk adjustment; use predictive modeling to identify patient populations in need of clinical interventions; identify opportunities for improvement in clinical processes that can lead to improved quality of care.
Operational How can we optimize our business operations in order to be more efficient? How do we deliver our services in order to improve the coordination of care for our patients and members? This application of data science focuses on efficiency and optimization of business practices in order to improve patient care; uses techniques including time series forecasting and geospatial analysis to address business problems such as staffing and scheduling; analyzes opportunities for business growth within the organization and predicts and forecasts expenses.
Policy What is the impact of health care policy on our patient population? On our most vulnerable patients and members? How will changes in reimbursement policy affect the way we deliver patient care? What partnerships can we develop in order to ensure that our patients and members continue receiving optimal care? Our data scientists are well-versed in healthcare policy; analyze areas for meaningful value investments that focus on improving health outcomes while saving money; use predictive modeling to identify high cost and high need patient populations who may be impacted most by changes in health policy.

Machine Learning Scientist – Data Team,$88K-$143K (Glassdoor est.),"Come join our team, and together we’ll realize the true potential of gene therapy!

Who we are

Dyno Therapeutics is a Cambridge based, VC-backed biotech startup that uses next-gen DNA technologies and machine learning to engineer Adeno-associated Virus (AAV) capsids for the effective delivery of gene therapies.

What we offer you

As a member of our quickly growing company, you’ll help us shape Dyno into a startup that takes its scientific mission seriously and provides a positive and supportive workplace environment. Dyno will have the opportunity to benefit from your insight, skills, and talent while enriching your professional and scientific experience as we grow the company together.

Our mission

At Dyno, we are expanding the boundaries of gene therapy. AAV capsids are currently the vector of choice for gene therapy, but they are only a starting point in the gene therapy revolution. Dyno aims to dramatically extend the reach of gene therapy by overcoming the limitations of existing AAV capsids, allowing more therapies to reach the clinic. Doing so will enable treatment for millions of patients with currently incurable, often disabling and deadly diseases.

How?

Dyno’s groundbreaking engineering pipeline harnesses advances in DNA library synthesis, high-throughput sequencing, and machine learning to generate transformative gene therapy vectors. We target the major barriers that separate AAV gene therapy research from real-world therapies, including delivery efficiency, tissue and cell-type specificity, immune evasion, and more. Our vectors will accelerate the transition of gene therapies from the lab to the clinic for the benefit of patients worldwide.

Where?

Dyno is located near Kendall Square in Cambridge. Situated within the dynamic LabCentral community, Dyno is working alongside other startups that are also creating the future of biomedicine.

General role

The data science team is at the heart of Dyno’s platform, and your work as a part of this team will have a potentially major impact on the future of gene therapy. The team's responsibilities span biological data analysis, machine learning model building, computational optimization, and experimental design of high-throughput viral libraries. Opportunities to apply rigorous theoretical approaches from combinatorial optimization, bayesian optimization, bandit strategies, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and compressive sensing in our platform abound. The successful candidate will have expertise in one of these (or related) topics and would like to apply them to a new domain. The field of capsid engineering is ripe with problems that are interesting from a learning perspective, and Dyno is well-placed to generate data at a scale at which these approaches can be fruitful.

As an early member of our team, you will have the opportunity to help craft our approach, shape our culture, and positively impact people’s lives. You will work closely with a group of talented, driven, and fun scientists. We are located in Lab Central in a dynamic community of biotech startups. The guideline below should give you a rough picture of who we are looking for, but depending on your background, you may bring different qualities to our team. Don't hesitate to write to us if you think you are a good fit. We offer competitive benefits.

Basic qualifications

BS, MS, or Ph.D. in a quantitative field (Machine learning, Math, Physics, CS, Operations Research, Statistics, ...) or equivalent experience.
Strong theoretical foundation in machine learning or a related domain.
Expertise in one or more general-purpose programming languages (such as Python or C/C++.)
